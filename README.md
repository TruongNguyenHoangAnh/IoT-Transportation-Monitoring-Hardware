# IoT-Transportation-Monitoring-Hardware
Hardware implementation of the IoT-based Transportation Monitoring System. This repository contains source code for microcontrollers (STM32/ESP32) to interface with sensors (GPS, temperature, vibration) and communication modules (LoRa/4G/5G/LTE), focusing on real-time data acquisition, processing, and transmission.
